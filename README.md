Hey guys, welcome to the website I created using Next.js and Tailwind. Check it out at this link: [yonkoom.vercel.app](https://yonkoom.vercel.app/). Hope you guys like it :)


I drew some inspiration from my favorite anime/manga known as One Piece, so things like the tab icon and the straw hat navbar logo are both references to it.
 
I want to shout-out libraries such as [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) and [typewriterjs](https://github.com/tameemsafi/typewriterjs) for allowing me to add some cool special effects and animations with ease to my page. I would also like to shout-out [spline](https://spline.design/) for allowing me to add a 3-D render of a house to my website giving more life to it.
