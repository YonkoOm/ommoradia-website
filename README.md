Hey guys, welcome to my interactive, mobile-friendly personal website that I made using Next.js, Tailwind, [Spline](https://spline.design), and [Framer-Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/). You can check it out [here](https://yonkoom.vercel.app/).

I drew some inspiration from my favorite anime/manga, One Piece, so things like the favicon and straw hat navbar icon are homages to it.

P.S. I'm using a 3-D model as a background piece on my website, so you may notice the site freeze for a very short period of time.
