Hey guys, welcome to my website which I created using Next.js and Tailwind. It
is both desktop- and mobile-friendly and you can check it out by clicking this
[link](https://yonkoom.vercel.app/).

I drew some inspiration from my favorite anime/manga One Piece, so things like
the tab icon and the straw hat navbar logo are both references to it.

Lastly, I want to give a quick shout to
[framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) and
[TypewriterJS](https://github.com/tameemsafi/typewriterjs) for allowing me to
add some cool animations to my website. I would also like to mention
[spline](https://spline.design) for giving me the ability to 3-D render a house
to the background of my website.

P.S. the house in the background may take a few seconds to render, so if you
notice the website freeze for a bit, please be patient for a second or two to
allow the house to render.

Thank you for visiting!
